# MinIO

[MinIO](https://min.io) is a distributed object storage service for high performance, high scale data infrastructures. It is a drop in replacement for AWS S3 in your own environment. It uses erasure coding to provide highly resilient storage that can tolerate failures of upto n/2 nodes. It runs on cloud, container, kubernetes and bare-metal environments. It is simple enough to be deployed in seconds, and can scale to 100s of peta bytes. MinIO is suitable for storing objects such as photos, videos, log files, backups, VM and container images.

MinIO supports [distributed mode](https://docs.minio.io/docs/distributed-minio-quickstart-guide). In distributed mode, you can pool multiple drives (even on different machines) into a single object storage server.

## Installation
------------

Download the configuration file with SLATE. 

`slate app get-conf minio --dev -o minio.yaml`

At a minimum you should configure the `Instance` tag, the service, and authentication. By default the service does not expose MinIO outside the cluster.

Authentication is configured by default to use an access key and a secret key. A default key has been written into the configuration file, which you may use. It is reccomended to provide the keys to your cluster as a secret using `slate secret create`, then configure MinIO to use the secret with the `existingSecret` value. It is also possible to configure MinIO to use TLS (https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/tls/kubernetes#2-create-kubernetes-secret).

Once you have saved the desired configuration, install your MinIO SLATE instance:

`slate app install minio --cluster <YOUR CLUSTER> --group <YOUR GROUP> --conf minio.yaml --dev`

Then run `slate instance info <INSTANCE ID>` to see information about your MinIO instance, including the endpoint which you will need to connect to later.


## Configuration

Some of the parameters above map to the env variables defined in the [MinIO DockerHub image](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio/).


## Distributed MinIO
-----------

This chart provisions a MinIO server in standalone mode, by default. To provision MinIO server in [distributed mode](https://docs.minio.io/docs/distributed-minio-quickstart-guide), set the `mode` field to `distributed`,

This provisions MinIO server in distributed mode with 4 nodes. To change the number of nodes in your distributed MinIO server, set the `replicas` field,

Note that the `replicas` value should be an integer between 4 and 16 (inclusive).

## Usage 

This application deploys the MinIO Server component. In order to create buckets and interact with the storage you will need to deploy the MinIO client somewhere. This section will detail the proccess of deploy a test client and connecting it to your SLATE MinIO Server instance. 

The easiest way to install and use the client is through Docker. Other installation options can be found at:

 https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide

To start the client in a docker container on your machine run:

`docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/sh minio/mc`

This command will drop you into the shell for your MinIO Client container. Run `mc --help` to see more information about the client.

To connect the client to your MinIO SLATE Server instance use

`mc config host add <ALIAS> <YOUR-ENDPOINT> <YOUR-ACCESS-KEY> <YOUR-SECRET-KEY>`

Example: `mc config host add myMinio http://192.168.254.143:9000 AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY`

The keys in the command above will work for you if you've left the default key configuration when you installed the server with SLATE. The endpoint will need to match the endpoint for your instance. Running `slate instance info <INSTANCE ID>` will retrieve information about your MinIO Server Instance. 

Once you are configured to use your SLATE MinIO instance you can create a bucket.

`mc mb myMinio/testBucket`

Then create a file and copy it into the new bucket.

`echo "some content" > myFile.txt && mc cp myFile.txt myMinio/testBucket`

You should be able to see your file in the new bucket.

`mc ls myMinio/testBucket`

This is a simple excercise to test your MinIO deployment. Complete documentation and usage can be found at:

https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-client-complete-guide

### StatefulSet [limitations](http://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/abstractions/controllers/statefulsets/#limitations) applicable to distributed MinIO

1. StatefulSets need persistent storage, so the `persistence.enabled` flag is ignored when `mode` is set to `distributed`.
2. When uninstalling a distributed MinIO release, you'll need to manually delete volumes associated with the StatefulSet.
